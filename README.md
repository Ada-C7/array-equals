# array-equals

Write a method named `arrayEquals` that accepts a pair of arrays of integers as parameters and returns `true` if the arrays contain the same elements in the same order. If the arrays are not the same length, your method should return `false`.

For example, if the following arrays are declared:

```
a1 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
a2 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
a3 = [20, 3, 50, 10, 68]
```

The call `arrayEquals(a1, a2)` returns `true` but the call `arrayEquals(a1, a3)` returns `false`.
